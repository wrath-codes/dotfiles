Now that we have the PRD, let's generate tasks for it.

Please follow the task generation process from @/Users/wrath/dotfiles/amp/.config/amp/prd/generate-tasks.md

Start by analyzing the PRD from our conversation, assess the current state of the codebase, then generate the parent tasks and wait for my confirmation before proceeding to sub-tasks.
